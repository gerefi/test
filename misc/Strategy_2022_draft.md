We still need software developers. 

Two years of microGerEFI and Proteus sales did not bring us much of new software developers. 
At the moment most of gerEFI Hellen boards are pretty successful as end-user products, not as means to bring new developers.

I think it's time to admit that we enjoy focusing on a small number of specific platforms instead of running thin trying to remotely
support gerEFI as a completely universal ECU.

Significant portion of gerEFI KiCAD work in 2021 was done by hired professionals. At the moment gerEFI LLC is focusing on building
a steady stream of revenue in order to hire software developers.

Our goal is still to develop the smartest open source ECU.
